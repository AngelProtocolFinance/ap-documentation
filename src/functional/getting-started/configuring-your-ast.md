## Decision Center 

The decision center is where all requests must be voted on to be approved or rejected. You can expand requests to see additional details, then simply click the approve or reject icon accordingly. Requests may include updating AST settings or taking various actions within the AST, such as making investments or updating the profile. You will be asked to confirm before proceeding.

## Admin Wallet

The Admin Wallet controls your AST and is comprised of the members you’ve selected. You can add and remove members here along with changing their voting weight. You can also adjust settings related to the proposal process such as # of members required to vote, duration, and auto-execution toggle.

## Permissions

This is where you can update who has permission to change or access different aspects of your AST. You can toggle between Admin Wallet or Delegate Wallets, and update delegates. You may also lock settings permanently. 

>  ⚠️ **Warning:** Locking settings permanently is ***irreversible***!
