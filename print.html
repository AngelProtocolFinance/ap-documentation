<img id="ap-logo" src="/assets/angelprotocol-H-logo.svg" alt="angelprotocol logo" />
<p>Welcome! I am excited you have decided to learn more about the Angel Smart Treasury (AST) from Angel Protocol. This book aims to help new developers to understand the functionality and power offered by Angel Protocol‚Äôs smart contract platform so that they can quickly start building on top of us to deliver new and innovative financial solutions.</p>
<h2 id="eli5-what-is-the-purpose-of-an-ast"><a class="header" href="#eli5-what-is-the-purpose-of-an-ast">ELI5: What is the purpose of an AST?</a></h2>
<p>An AST provides you with the tools to fund-raise, coordinate, and invest capital in a transparent and friction-less manner. ASTs connect donors and investors with non-profits, social enterprises and other change-makers around the world. It is a customizable, powerful, web3 infrastructure available in minutes!</p>
<h2 id="who-should-read-this-book"><a class="header" href="#who-should-read-this-book">Who should read this book?</a></h2>
<p>In our humble opinion, everyone should read this. That said, there are certain areas that will be more relevant to certain readers.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a higher level overview of the Angel Protocol ecosystem you can check out that guide here [LINK]. We also provide a UI-focused guide for users that do not want or need to directly interact with the smart contracts and would prefer to use the provided web application for managing their AST.</p>
<p>If you are <em>not</em> technically inclined, you should first read the <a href="./functional/overview/main.html">Functional Documentation</a> chapters to get a complete understanding of what Angel Protocol is, what the ASTs can do, and how to work with the existing Angel Protocol website UI.</p>
<p>If you <em>are</em> technically savvy or just want to dive deeper then the <a href="./technical/overview/main.html">Technical Documentation</a> chapters are for you. These were written primarily with developers and tech-savvy users in mind. It will help if you come in with an understanding of how the Polygon blockchain (or a similar EVM-based blockchain such as  Ethereum) and Solidity smart contracts work. We will be diving deeper into the technical aspects of how to use the Angel Protocol smart contracts directly here.</p>
<p>Regardless of the path you chose, there is a lot to learn in the coming pages that will help you better understand and use our platform. Stick with it and you might be surprised!</p>
<h2 id="how-to-read-this-book"><a class="header" href="#how-to-read-this-book">How to read this book?</a></h2>
<p>Think of this book as a &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; format rather than a classic novel you need to read cover to cover.</p>
<p>This guide is written to provide explanations and details behind of ASTs and UI guides in our &quot;Functional Documentation&quot; sections. There we walk new users through how they can use our existing site to configure, launch, and manage their AST, all without a single line of code required!</p>
<p>In the &quot;Technical Documentation&quot; section of this book, we provide deeper explanations and breakdown the code behind ASTs using code snippets and contract interfaces that would be commonly encountered when using an AST programmatically. We have ordered the first sections to quickly orient users to the core logic and structures at play in the Angel Protocol contracts and Endowments that are important to understand first, we then dive into the AST creation process and the basics of using an AST multisig. With those foundations in place we build upon that, covering the various day-to-day scenarios that AST members can expect to encounter. Each section covers the overview of the setup, players and contracts involved, any important logic points or considerations. We will also look at relevant code snippets for the involved endpoints as well as any important structs as we go.</p>

<p>Angel Protocol provides fintech infrastructure that enables anyone to create &amp; embed tokenized financial products in minutes with little to no coding required. When you build with us, you build on smart contracts that are executed on a blockchain network. This means that you don‚Äôt have to create and maintain accounts in the traditional financial system. We provide you with all the infrastructure and UI you need to interact in compliance with the financial system: fiat on/off-ramps, KYC, etc. These financial products are referred to as Angel Smart Treasuries and allow users to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pool funds from around the world at low cost </li>
<li>Invest in a carefully curated set of tokenized assets</li>
<li>Make collective investment decisions</li>
<li>Mint tokens for collective ownership and fundraising</li>
<li>Improve transparency &amp; trust</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can further set a variety of parameters to program their AST with no additional coding required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define how funds are locked</li>
<li>Set contributors and beneficiaries</li>
<li>Set a maturity date and associated logic</li>
<li>Set who has permissions to execute actions</li>
<li>Lock forever any of these parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't need to be a blockchain expert to utilize ASTs. Communicating with smart contracts is as easy as any traditional API integration. Create your API request and configure your financial product in only a few minutes. Use our open-source components for your UI:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wallet connect &amp; drop-down</li>
<li>Cross-chain deposits</li>
<li>Registration flow &amp; on-boarding for your clients</li>
<li>Fully-fledged marketplace &amp; user profiles</li>
<li>Management dashboard</li>
</ul>

<p>With Angel Protocol you can build or embed the ability to invest in tokenized assets &amp; yield, coordinate using decentralized governance, and program trust-less execution in less than 60 minutes. We combine the best of tokenized infrastructure in one powerful but simple product, providing all the benefits of Web3 while abstracting away the complexity.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-use-angel-protocol"><a class="header" href="#why-use-angel-protocol">Why use Angel Protocol?</a></h1>
<p>The tokenization of assets is both revolutionary and inevitable. Significant value, efficiency, and democratization of access are unlocked with the move from traditional to tokenized assets (along with new blue oceans of possibility through programmable, trust-less execution). Those who embrace and leverage this technology gain a significant competitive advantage. However, building customized financial products is out of reach for most businesses and individuals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regulation &amp; Intermediaries:</strong> Time-to-market often takes anywhere from 2 to 6 months, or longer if not utilizing a Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) provider</li>
<li><strong>Development Cost:</strong> Minimum development cost for a new financial product can easily exceed $150K for simple functionality</li>
<li><strong>Cumbersome:</strong> It can take &gt;1,000 lines of code required to tie together multiple API providers to make a product</li>
</ul>
<p>Angel Protocol‚Äôs infrastructure makes customized financial products available for all, with no friction:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fast:</strong> It takes &lt;60 min to configure and launch a 100% bespoke financial product</li>
<li><strong>Cheap:</strong> No upfront fees or subscriptions mean you can launch your product for free</li>
<li><strong>Convenient:</strong> Programmable infrastructure with an open-source UI so you only need to deal with 1 solution</li>
</ul>
<p>We do the heavy lifting for you, carefully researching, selecting, and assessing the risk of assets available for investment. We continuously vet and integrate third-party tools that support the operations of decentralized organizations (payroll, accounting, project management, etc.)</p>
<h2 id="revenue-sharing"><a class="header" href="#revenue-sharing">Revenue Sharing</a></h2>
<p>A unique feature of our infrastructure is you actually get paid to build on Angel Protocol, enjoying a 20% revenue share from all financial products you create. You will automatically receive your share of all fees generated by those financial products that are created with your referrer address in the API request. Further, a portion of all Angel Protocol fees get redirected to social impact. You win, your customers win, and the world wins.
You no longer need to invest significant time and resources to build the financial products your customers deserve. Take ownership into your own hands with the power and simplicity of Angel Protocol‚Äôs infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="cost-leading-pricing-model"><a class="header" href="#cost-leading-pricing-model">Cost-leading Pricing Model</a></h2>
<p>We believe in democratizing access to financial opportunity regardless of a person‚Äôs wealth or location. Thus, we charge no setup costs, take no cut of incoming contributions, and have no subscription fees. We only win when our customers win, charging 1% on balances (per annum) and 1.5% on withdrawals (of funds leaving Angel Protocol). Simple, transparent, and inclusive.
We plan to introduce a premium service in the future for those seeking a dedicated account manager, white-glove help desk, technical assistance for integration, and help with admin/legal. Currently, the cost is free: <a href="https://angelprotocol.io/talk-to-us/" target="blank">talk to us</a>.</p>
<h2 id="who-uses-angel-protocol"><a class="header" href="#who-uses-angel-protocol">Who uses Angel Protocol?</a></h2>
<p>Angel Protocol‚Äôs infrastructure is trusted by over 170 organizations around the world and can be utilized for a variety of different use cases related to raising, investing, and coordinating funds. Some examples include: </p>
<ul>

<h2 id="step-1-wallet-creation"><a class="header" href="#step-1-wallet-creation">Step 1: Wallet Creation</a></h2>
<p>You will need a tokenized asset wallet to interact with your AST. Already have a wallet for tokenized assets? Great, you are all set! Skip to the next section.
New to tokenized assets? No problem! You can quickly and easily set up your wallet with simply an email address using Web3Auth wallet.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-about"><a class="header" href="#step-2-about">Step 2: About</a></h2>
<p>Once you have your wallet setup, you are ready to begin creating your AST. In this section you can provide basic information like name and brief description/tagline.</p>
<p><img src="functional/getting-started/../../assets/screenshots/about-ast.png" alt="about" title="about AST Launchpad" /></p>
<h2 id="step-3-ast-management-settings"><a class="header" href="#step-3-ast-management-settings">Step 3: AST Management Settings</a></h2>
<p>Next you can setup the management of your AST. This determines your AST‚Äôs voting parameters and voting members. You must weigh security against operational efficiency when determining how many members are required to pass a vote (more members = more security, fewer members = more operational efficiency).</p>
<p>In the first section, you choose your AST members. In the second section, you choose the minimum required participation level, proposal duration, and whether proposals execute automatically once quorum is reached.</p>
<p><img src="functional/getting-started/../../assets/screenshots/members-ast.png" alt="members" title="members AST Launchpad" /></p>

<h2 id="step-5-maturity"><a class="header" href="#step-5-maturity">Step 5: Maturity</a></h2>
<p>If you‚Äôd like to set a maturity date/action for your AST, you may do so here. This is useful for any situation where you would like to release access of funds to specific beneficiaries at a specific time, such as when setting up trusts. It can also be used as a recovery fail-safe by setting up a separate recovery wallet as the beneficiary at a future date.</p>

<h2 id="step-6-split-of-contribution"><a class="header" href="#step-6-split-of-contribution">Step 6: Split of Contribution</a></h2>
<p>There may be situations where you would like AST funds split between locked (principal protected) &amp; liquid (available) accounts. By default, contributors to your AST can choose how their contribution is split between these locked &amp; liquid accounts. You may choose to modify that option here by setting default and minimum/maximum ranges, or deactivate it altogether.</p>

<h2 id="simple-multisig"><a class="header" href="#simple-multisig">Simple Multisig</a></h2>
<p>The default setup for AST on creation is a multisig (i.e. Admin Wallet). This is the simplest form of an AST. At any time, the owners of ASTs can opt-in for tokenized governance with either an existing token or by creating a new token. At the moment of the opt-in, the owners can decide which parameters of the AST fall under the governance and which are still controlled by the native multi-sig.</p>
<p><img src="functional/examples/../../assets/examples/simple-multisig.png" alt="simple-multisig" title="simple-multisig" /></p>
<h2 id="existing-token"><a class="header" href="#existing-token">Existing Token</a></h2>
<p>When the owners of an AST decide to opt-in for DAO governance using an existing token, a governance contract is instantiated that allows token holders to vote on the parameters that have been chosen by the contract owner.</p>
<p>Eligible tokens are pre-approved by the AP DAO along with a designated AMM token pair contract address that is used to convert fees from the AST (generally denominated in stablecoins) into the token in use for distribution to stakers as rewards.</p>
<p>The owners of an AST can instantiate a Matching contract that contains a reserve of tokens that are distributed to contributors following a set of rules defined by the governance of the AST.</p>

<div class="badge">On-chain Endowments & Fundraising Marketplace</div>
<h2 id="about"><a class="header" href="#about">About</a></h2>
<p>Angel Giving provides nonprofits across the world with free access to their own endowment and a marketing page on a global charity marketplace. Donations are directed to a NPO‚Äôs AST account and automatically invested in low-risk, high-yielding products made possible by blockchain technologies. Every week, a portion of the interest from those DeFi products is sent to the charity and the remainder is automatically reinvested, compounding in perpetuity to provide sustainable funding.
Angel Giving is a global team of individuals with backgrounds in philanthropy and technology, passionate about building a world where humanity is empowered with the financial security to solve our grand challenges. Their incredible community raised over $6 million dollars in donations to more than 160 charities, with $1.5M raised to fight climate change, $500k in humanitarian relief for those impacted by Typhoon Rai, and over $200k to support Ukrainian refugees.</p>
<h2 id="goals"><a class="header" href="#goals">Goals</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Democratize access to financial opportunity for nonprofits so they can enjoy financial sustainability regardless of their size, resources, or location</li>
<li>Ensure all nonprofits have access to a free fundraising profile and embeddable donation widget on their site </li>
<li>Promote charitable giving on-chain and connect giving partners to beneficiary NPOs</li>
<li>Provide donors access to on-chain DAFs to donate and manage tokenized assets </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="parameters"><a class="header" href="#parameters">Parameters</a></h2>
<p>Angel Giving integrates AST functionality directly into their front end and utilizes a registration process to onboard NPOs. That registration process allows NPOs to create pre-configured ASTs designed to work as endowments, and generates a fundraising marketplace page where the NPO can be discovered on Angel Giving‚Äôs marketplace. The marketplace front end is open-sourced and available to leverage for the creation of similar or modified products. Below are the pre-configured and adjustable parameters for NPOs:</p>
<p><strong>Admin Wallet:</strong> Default multisig created for each NPO initially using the registration wallet</p>
<p><strong>Admin Settings:</strong> Set by NPO</p>
<p><strong>Locked and Liquid Settings:</strong> Chosen by donor on marketplace (defaulted to 100% locked), or chosen by NPO during widget creation</p>
<p><strong>Fees:</strong> No additional fees added, Angel Giving seeks to be a cost leader to be an inclusive as possible for financially strained NPOs</p>
<p><strong>Donor Verification:</strong> Set by NPO</p>
<p><strong>Investments:</strong> A preset plan is devised to automatically send 75% of yield generated within Locked funds to Liquid</p>

<p>There are two important smart contracts that you <strong>must</strong> be aware of as a developer looking to understand the Angel Protocol ecosystem. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registrar Contract</li>
<li>Accounts Contract</li>
</ul>
<p>We will cover each of them in turn in the next sections.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="registrar-contract"><a class="header" href="#registrar-contract">Registrar Contract</a></h1>
<p>This contract serves as THE source of truth for all other Angel Protocol contracts on a given blockchain. It holds a large number of values in its storage struct that most other contracts will query to get the correct values for their own operations. It is owned and controlled by the Angel Protocol Team‚Äôs Admin multisig contract. Only this multisig can modify this contracts values.</p>
<p>The full config struct of the Registrar contract (as returned from a query to the getConfig endpoint):</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">struct Config {
    address owner; // AP TEAM MULTISIG
    address applicationsReview;
    address indexFundContract;
    address accountsContract;
    address treasury;
    address subdaoGovCode;
    address subdaoCw20TokenCode;
    address subdaoBondingTokenCode;

    AngelCoreStruct.SplitDetails splitToLiquid;
    address haloToken;
    address haloTokenLpContract;
    address govContract;
    address collectorAddr;
    uint256 collectorShare;
    address charitySharesContract;
    AngelCoreStruct.AcceptedTokens acceptedTokens;
    address fundraisingContract;
    AngelCoreStruct.RebalanceDetails rebalance;
    address swapsRouter;
    address multisigFactory;
    address multisigEmitter;
    address charityProposal;
    address lockedWithdrawal;
    address proxyAdmin;
    address usdcAddress;
    address wethAddress;
    address cw900lvAddress;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Aside from managing the various contract addresses and wallet variables, the Registrar is also responsible for the curation of approved ‚ÄúStrategies‚Äù (ie. What ASTs invest their funds into) and ‚ÄúNetwork Information‚Äù about other external chains that Angel Protocol has Strategy Vaults deployed on.
The last important thing the Registrar handles is the management of the protocol level ‚ÄúFees‚Äù that can be setup and applied when Endowments take certain actions like withdrawing funds from the protocol or when a harvest of Strategy vaults takes place.</p>
<p>Overall, the Registrar contract is a critically important contract to be aware of as you‚Äôre reading and understanding the code. It is everywhere, and yet it is not a contract you will ever really need to interact with directly.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="accounts-contract-diamond"><a class="header" href="#accounts-contract-diamond">Accounts Contract (Diamond)</a></h1>
<p>This diamond contract is where all of the core business logic that governs all ASTs lives. If you are unfamiliar with what a Diamond is please stop and read over the <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535" target="_blank">EIP-2535 specification</a> to get an understanding and then come back here. Don‚Äôt worry we will wait! :) Everything else beyond this point will make a lot more sense after that.</p>
<p>The Accounts contract is responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking all existing Endowment accounts in the Angel Protocol ecosystem, their current status, and their configuration settings</li>
<li>Managing the internal ledger for all Endowment balances</li>
<li>Correctly applying logic for inbound deposits and outbound withdraws</li>
<li>Providing the infrastructure to allow Endowment owners to make investments and redemptions to/from any Angel Protocol Strategy vaults, whether those are on the same chain or a different chain entirely</li>
<li>Allow Endowment owners the ability to update their Configuration settings and manage things like permissions and control over changing various parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>The other important concepts to wrap your head around, before we dive deeper into the code, is the distinction between the different types of Endowments, as well as the internal, accounting setup for all Endowment balances. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="types-of-endowments"><a class="header" href="#types-of-endowments">Types of Endowments</a></h1>
<p>Angel Protocol has two types of Endowments at the smart contract level: Charity Endowments &amp; Normal Endowments. The internal representation for an EndowmentType in the contracts is an enum:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">enum EndowmentType {
    Charity,
    Normal,
    None
}
</code></pre>
<p>Charity Endowments are specialized Endowments reserved only for vetted and verified Non-Profit Organizations. These are outside the scope of this guide, but it is important to know they exist for when you see them mentioned throughout the logic in the smart contracts codebase. Normal Endowments are  ASTs. So when you see references to ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù Endowments in the codebase, just think AST and you will be okay. We will use AST throughout this guide to avoid any confusion. AST Endowments have far greater flexibility with regards to their configuration options and their management capabilities. They are the v2 of the Charity Endowments.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="endowment-balance-accounting"><a class="header" href="#endowment-balance-accounting">Endowment Balance Accounting</a></h1>
<p>Regardless of their Type, all Endowments recorded in the Accounts contract have a Locked Account and an Liquid Account balance. Internally in the contracts this is represented by an enum AccountType:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">enum AccountType {
    Locked,
    Liquid,
    None
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Locked portion represents the balance that is...well locked and cannot be withdrawn. It is helpful to think of this as the ‚Äúendowment‚Äù portion of your account, the part that is set aside to be invested and grow un-distributed. The Liquid portion can be thought of like a current (or checking) bank account where there are little to no restriction on how much, to whom, or when money can be taken out of it.</p>

         alt="Basic Flow of Funds in Angel Protocol">
	<figcaption>High-level view of how funds can enter, exit, and move while within Angel Protocol.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All funds enter Angel Protocol via deposits into an Endowment‚Äôs un-invested ‚Äúbucket‚Äù of funds, which we refer to in the contracts as ‚Äútokens-on-hand‚Äù. Theses buckets exist in a locked and liquid version. All investments and redemptions are carried out from and return back to the respective tokens-on-hand bucket from which they originated. All AST withdraws are pulled from the Liquid tokens-on-hand bucket only.</p>
<p>For invested locked funds, harvest events are where a certain percentage of the earnings generated by those funds are unlocked and moved into the liquid-version of the same strategy, freeing them up to be redeemed to a liquid tokens-on-hand bucket and withdraw if desired. This is how Angel Protocol Endowments throw off an income stream for ASTs. </p>

<p>Any user who wishes to do so may create an AST. To do so you must use the createEndowment function on the Accounts diamond contract facet ‚ÄúAccountsCreateEndowment‚Äù. This endpoint expects an extensive configuration message that lays out all of the settings and parameters for the new AST. We will cover the function itself and the logic the message arguments and what they are for.</p>
<p>The <code>createEndowment</code> function payload on the Accounts contract facet <code>AccountsCreateEndowment</code> expects a single argument struct like so: </p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">struct CreateEndowmentRequest {

<p>The maturityTime field, if non-zero, sets the time that the Endowment will mature at. If <code>0</code> the endowment effectively has no maturity date (indefinite).</p>
<h2 id="categories-and-un-sdgs"><a class="header" href="#categories-and-un-sdgs">Categories and UN SDGs</a></h2>
<p><code>AngelCoreStruct.Categories categories;</code>
This field expects a Categories struct which lays out the UN SDGs and General categories that apply to an Endowment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">struct Categories {
    uint256[] sdgs;
    uint256[] general;
}
</code></pre>
<p>SDGs are used mostly with Charity endowments only, though they could be used by an AST if desired, though having at least 1 SDG set is not a requirement for them, unlike with Charity endowments. General categories is a open, flexible system thin which AST owners can set integer values on chain for internally defined categories. This General category might be useful for users that have many ASTs or those that have my sub-AST (child ASTs) that want to group them by internal classifiers.</p>

<p>These fields are simple, informational string values that will help identify your AST endowment on-chain and can be used by those who are not using supplemental database storage for AST information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Name: The name of your AST</li>
<li>Logo: A URL string that points to your AST‚Äôs logo image</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="kyc-required"><a class="header" href="#kyc-required">KYC Required</a></h2>
<p><code>bool kycDonorsOnly;</code>
If set to true, the AST is stating its preference for only receiving funds from KYC‚Äôd donors/contributors. This is something that would be read by and enforced from the front-end environment, as there is currently no real way to do this on-chain today.</p>

<ul>
<li>cw4_members: A list of EVM addresses that should be setup as the starting owners/members of the AST Endowment multisig</li>

<p><code>ThresholdEnum</code> struct specifies the type of threshold used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">enum ThresholdEnum {
    AbsoluteCount,

<p>These values setup the allow lists for what restrictions, if any, will exist for those wallets that will be beneficiaries of or contributors to the AST. If an empty array is passed it is assumed that there should be NO restrictions on that field (ie. Any wallet address will be allowed). 
The maturityWhitelist field is the set of addresses that can access the AST funds at the time of maturity. It is distinct from the other two whitelists here, which apply only while the AST is not yet mature. </p>

<p>Multisig contracts are commonplace in web3. They allow groups of users (the owners or members as they are often referred to as) to do things like approve transactions of shared assets held by their multisig contract and in general allow for better security of funds and addresses replacing users when they lose access to or have their signing wallet compromised. There a many different implementations of multisig contracts, but they usually share core similarities.</p>
<h2 id="multisig-transactions"><a class="header" href="#multisig-transactions">Multisig Transactions</a></h2>
<p>A transaction must collect signatures of approval from the members of the multisig. Just like in the &quot;real-world&quot;, where voter petitions to a governing body need to have some thousands of signatures before it can be read before parliament, so too must a multisig transaction collect certain a number of signatures from its owners. The number of signatures that is required for a proposed transaction to have before it can be executed on-chain is called the threshold.</p>
<p>Once a transaction has collected signatures above the threshold, it can be executed by any valid wallet address on-chain. Execution is not limited to the member addresses themselves, which is useful when it comes to other contracts or scripts being able to execute transactions. </p>

         alt="Basic overview of AST Multsig">
	<figcaption>Shows the various steps and players involved in using an AST multisig contract, from initial transaction submission, confirmations, to the final execution of the payload.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All actions taking place with a multisig follow the same flow: </p>
<ol>
<li>Propose a transaction</li>
<li>Achieve a passing level threshold of confirmations</li>
<li>Execute the proposed transaction to the destination contract</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="submitting-a-transaction"><a class="header" href="#submitting-a-transaction">Submitting a transaction</a></h2>
<p>Everything starts with a multisig member submitting a transaction for consideration for execution by the other members of a multisig. The output of a successful submission would be the resulting transaction ID.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>NOTE:</strong> Take care to record this returned Endowment ID! It will be important for all members to interact with and sign a transaction and to lookup the status of a transaction. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This message and args would look something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">submitTransaction(&quot;A short title&quot;, &quot;description of the proposed transaction&quot;, &quot;0x..1003&quot;, 0, &lt;withdraw msg as binary&gt;)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="confirming-a-transaction"><a class="header" href="#confirming-a-transaction">Confirming a transaction</a></h2>
<p>In order to confirm a pending multisig transaction members of the multisig must confirm the transaction. Members have several options available to them with regards to exercising their voting powers on a multisig contract for which they must submit the following messages, each time passing the transaction ID along as the sole argument:</p>
<h3 id="confirm-a-transaction-approval-vote-for-execution"><a class="header" href="#confirm-a-transaction-approval-vote-for-execution">Confirm a Transaction (approval vote for execution)</a></h3>
<p><code>confirmTransaction(uint256 transactionId)</code></p>
<h3 id="revoke-a-confirmation-rescind-a-confirmation-previously-submitted-for-a-transaction"><a class="header" href="#revoke-a-confirmation-rescind-a-confirmation-previously-submitted-for-a-transaction">Revoke a confirmation (rescind a confirmation previously submitted for a transaction)</a></h3>
<p><code>revokeConfirmation(uint256 transactionId)</code></p>
<p>Once a transaction has acquired enough confirmations to meet the passing threshold level set it is ready for the final step: Execution!</p>
<h2 id="executing-a-passing-transaction"><a class="header" href="#executing-a-passing-transaction">Executing a passing transaction</a></h2>
<p>The hard work of gathering consensus among multisig members for a proposed transaction has been carried out. Now the time has come to execute the transaction. This requires a single submission, which can be submitted by any valid EOA wallet, and will pass so long as:</p>
<ol>
<li>The threshold for a transaction has been met</li>
<li>The data payload is valid and does not cause downstream errors that would cause the transaction to fail.</li>
</ol>
<p>The execution message is very simple and looks like this: 
<code>executeTransaction(uint256 transactionId)</code></p>

<p>Managing internal affairs of an AST multisig is the same process as any other transaction. The only difference is really that the destination is set as the multisig contract itself. This sort of setup is used for many common tasks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adding a new member (owner)
<code>addOwner(address owner)</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removing a member (owner)
<code>removeOwner(address owner)</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replacing an existing member (owner) with a new one. This is useful for when an existing member loses access to their wallet or has it compromised and needs to change to a new wallet.
<code>replaceOwner(address owner, address newOwner)</code></p>
</li>

<p>In order to be useful, ASTs need to be able to receive funds from the outside world. We refer to these as deposits on the contracts. Deposits are open to the world by default, but can be restricted to a specific whitelisted set of contributor addresses, if so desired.</p>
<p>Inversely, ASTs need to send money out into the world from it's pool of tokens held on hand in their Liquid balances. This could be for things like paying a supplier for services, paying employees salaries, or many other things. Like deposits, withdraws are set to be capable of being sent to any address, though like with deposits we've added logic to allow this to be restricted to a finite list of beneficiaries.</p>

         alt="Deposits into an AST">
	<figcaption>Basic logic is illustrated, showing the flow of funds from a donor/contributor that wishes to deposit some funds into an AST.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is accomplished with the send of a valid deposit message to the Accounts contract any wallet. We will assume there are no restrictions on the wallets that can interact with the deposit endpoints for the sake of this example. Valid deposit message are supposed to be an ERC20 that exists in the Registrar contract‚Äôs approved tokens list. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function depositERC20(
    AccountMessages.DepositRequest memory curDetails,
    address curTokenaddress,
    uint256 curAmount
) external;
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see we would need to pass along the amount to deposit, the token address of the deposit token, and a <code>DepositRequest</code> struct. That struct is rather simple and provides the Accounts contract further information about splits the user desires and which Endowment ID to credit the deposit to. It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">struct DepositRequest {
    uint256 id;
    uint256 lockedPercentage;
    uint256 liquidPercentage;

<ol>
<li>An endowment member creates a transaction on the endowment multisig using the submitTransaction endpoint, with the destination address as the Accounts contract, a value set as 0 and the calldata for withdraw with liquid option. </li>
<li>Other endowment members sign the transaction on multisig identified by transaction id.</li>
<li>Once (n/2+1)[the default, unless changed] signers sign transaction, it can be executed. However, this will happen automatically if the <code>require_execution</code> is set to false in the multisig config.</li>
